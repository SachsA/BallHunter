# BallHunter
## OpenGL Final Project

##### Project done in Computer Graphics, at KMU, South Korea

### The Project

##### The goal of the game is to hit various objects by throwing balls at them. The ball is stick to a line fixed to an anchor.
##### You have to pull the ball to give it a force. The more you pull the faster it'll go.
